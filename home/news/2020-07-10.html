		<div class="content">In June, Native Plant Society of Oregon (NPSO) Citizen’s Rare Plant Watch volunteers set out to search for a historical occurrence of the rare Erigeron howellii (Howell’s daisy) in the Columbia River Gorge. Within ten minutes of hiking we passed a small waterfall and as we approached, we noticed a member of the Saxifragaceae covering the cliff directly under the falls. This turned out to be a previously undocumented occurrence of the rare Sullivantia oregana (Oregon coolwort)! We pulled out our data sheets and began collecting data on the population including location, a count of individuals, habitat description, potential threats, and lots of photographs.</div>
