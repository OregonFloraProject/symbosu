		<p>In the plant-insect interactions chapter in <i>Flora of Oregon Volume 2</i>, Andy Moldenke tells the story of <i>Nemophila menziesii</i> (baby blue eyes) and its specialist pollinator, the solitary bee <i>Andrena nigripes</i>. The male bee emerges several days before the female bee, so large sites with ecological and temperature variability are important to sustain both the flowers and the bees. Oak woodlands and savannas provided this habitat variability, and a Nature Conservancy Reserve north of Eugene was one of the only remaining sites Andy was familiar with that currently had the ecological diversity needed. This reminded me of one of my favorite sites for observing early spring wildflowers: on the cliffs along Richardson Road west of Walton in Oregon&rsquo;s Coast Range. The moist, moss-covered cliffs and rounded knobs of sandstone along the Siuslaw River faced to the south, southeast, and southwest and warmed up early, supporting an ever-changing display of wildflowers in the thick, spongy moss. I had encountered baby blue eyes as early as the first week in January and as late as May, so these warm, moist rock faces with a scattered overstory of dwarf white oak seemed like it might meet the needs of <i>Andrena nigripes</i>.

		<p>Baby blue eyes was not the only showy spring wildflower on the seeps. Delicate tubular <i>Cascadia nuttallii</i> (Nuttall&rsquo;s saxifrage) carpeted the moist rock, broken by scattered clumps of <i>Romanzoffia californica</i> (California mistmaiden). Where organic soil collected in cracks, there were dense clumps of <i>Micranthes marshallii</i> (Marshall&rsquo;s saxifrage), which was also common in moist depressions at the base of the cliffs, along with <i>Erythranthe guttata</i> (monkeyflower). Plants of the tiny <i>Erythranthe alsinoides</i> (chickweed monkeyflower), yellow with a red spot on the lower lip, also grew in moist cracks and the dense, seepy moss. Bright green <i>Selaginella wallacei</i> (Wallace&rsquo;s selaginellla) clung to the bare rock, detaching from the cliff face in dense mats following heavy rains. As the summer progressed, <i>Plectritis congesta</i> (rosy plectritis) and <i>Montia parvifolia</i> (littleleaf miners lettuce) appeared on the moss-covered cliffs, and as the mosses dried out, <i>Clarkia purpurea</i> ssp. <i>viminea</i> (purple godetia) blanketed the slope in purple.

		<p>In late February 2020, scattered plants of <i>Nemophila menziesii</i> were flowering on the lower cliff, but not yet at its moist base.  When I returned late in the afternoon of March 10, <i>Nemophila</i> was flowering from the rounded top of the cliff, at the bases of the scattered dwarf white oak, down the entire cliff face to the ditch at the base of the cliff. Large parts of the cliff were in shade, but in a localized patch of sun, I spotted a pair of solitary bees with the back of the thorax covered with red hair, characteristic of <i>Andrena nigripes</i>.
		</p>
		<p>One week later, late on a sunny afternoon, I visited the site with Andy Moldenke. Many bees were flying, including several species of <i>Andrena</i>, bumblebees, and a diversity of other bee families. It only took Andy a few minutes to find both male and female <i>Andrena nigripes</i> pollinating the flowers of the baby blue eyes. Andy commented that if <i>Andrena nigripes</i> were here, we should also find the bee&rsquo;s parasite, a vespid wasp&mdash;&mdash;within a few minutes Andy sighted the parasite as well. The loose, sandy soil at the base of the cliff and along the road edge provide an abundance of nesting sites for the ground nesting <i>Andrena</i> bee, but we didn&rsquo;t locate any nests during this short trip. However, we did see individuals pollinating baby blue eyes along two sections of cliff over two miles apart, so there are likely additional populations along the 7 miles of scattered cliff bordering Richardson Road. Exploring similar open savanna-like cliff faces along the Siuslaw and other nearby rivers may reveal more occurrences of <i>Andrena nigripes</i> and the baby blue eyes they depend on.
