		<p>Before OregonFlora began its work to create a new plant manual for the state, the last published flora came out in 1961. 
			This millennium's flora is being published as a <a href="https://oregonflora.org/pages/store.php">three-volume, hardbound set</a>. 
			Says one reviewer of Volume 1 (2015):  "There is now a new standard of excellence for a state flora."  
			With full descriptions for each plant species, identification keys, pen and ink illustrations, and front chapters with color photographs providing context to the details, these volumes are works that will stand the test of time.  
		</p>
		<p>Plant diversity is always changing, however, which is why OregonFlora also presents its information in digital form through this website. 
			The benefits are many: we can constantly update information; 
			interactive maps and thousands of color photos aren't practical in paper form; 
			data sharing with other organizations and people is easy to do; 
			and access through the internet opens the exploration of Oregon's plant life to everyone.  
		</p>
		<p>So why bother with books when there's a website? Both formats have unique things to offer. 
			The scientific illustrations in the printed volumes are not only works of art, they communicate the features of a plant species in ways that photographs cannot. 
			While the online interactive keys offer a way to identify most plants, the precise language in the books' descriptions and dichotomous keys make a definitive identification a given. 
			The appendices and the front chapters in each volume offer readers a deep dive into Oregon plants and how they relate to our lives. 
			And your enjoyment of the information OregonFlora offers can happen even when there's no internet connection!  
		</p>
		<p>We relish the opportunity to bring knowledge of Oregon's plant diversity to broad audiences through our website. 
			Helping people understand and appreciate how their lives&mdash;how all life on the planet&mdash;depend upon plants is an underlying value of OregonFlora. 
			Fortunately, there's opportunity to do this through different tools. 
			We hope you will explore OregonFlora&mdash;both on paper and online.
