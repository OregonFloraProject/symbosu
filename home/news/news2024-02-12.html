		<p>When working to return native plant species to a habitat that is dominated by non-natives, understanding the plant diversity of the site is the essential first step. OregonFlora's information is a great resource that can be used to develop sustainable practices on working agricultural lands that can contribute to both economic and ecological successes.</p>

		<p>Too often, “nature” is kept separate from managed ag lands such as rangeland, orchards, vineyards, and pastures. To blur the boundaries between wild and working land—to reclaim bits of the managed landscape and to reestablish the suite of native plants that thrive in varied habitats—expands ecosystem biodiversity. The benefits that robust ecosystems provide are both tangible and intangible: diverse plant communities that are adapted to a given place can extend a grazing season, support other native wildlife, hold water on a landscape through dry seasons, and improve water quality. Native habitats also impart a sense of place, and can be a both a refuge and a bridge between larger areas managed strictly for conservation. </p>

		<p>Here we’ll describe how some of the tools on this website can help land managers discover the plant diversity of their areas of interest and use this knowledge to make pastures and rangeland prosperous for both the financial bottom line and regional ecosystems. There are also tutorials for each tool <a href="https://oregonflora.org/pages/tutorials.php" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<p><b>What plants are on my property?</b> Open the <a href="https://oregonflora.org/spatial/index.php" target="_blank">mapping</a> tool, and in the 'Define an Area' box, choose to draw either a circle or a polygon around your area of interest. Click or tap to select the shape—its outline will become thicker—and then hit the green “load records” button. The map will display dots of each plant occurrence record in the OregonFlora database; you can view and download lists of the plants organized by the record or the plant names.</p>

		<p>Draw similar polygons around adjacent areas or parks and preserves that can serve as reference ecosystems to compare the species found there to your holdings. </p>
		 
		<p><b>How do I learn about a particular plant?</b> Each of the plants featured on the OregonFlora website has a plant profile page, and for ~every instance of a scientific name that appears on our website, the name is a link to that plant’s profile page. Profile pages have descriptions, maps, photos, and links to additional resources. You can also type any plant's common or scientific name into the search box, found at the top of every page, to access its profile page. </p>

		<p><b>Which plants are Oregon natives?</b> The native/exotic status of a species is listed on its profile page. Additionally, <a href="https://oregonflora.org/pages/data/Natives_OregonFlora.csv" target="_blank">here</a> is a list of all native plants.</p>

		<p><b>How can I identify a plant?</b> By placing your location on its map, the <a href="https://oregonflora.org/checklists/dynamicmap.php?interface=key" target="_blank">Identify Plants</a> tool generates a list of all species documented within that region; you can then select the features you recognize on your unknown plant to narrow the choices down to an identification. </p> 

		<p><b>Where can I learn about species to plant on my property?</b> The <a href="https://oregonflora.org/garden/index.php" target="_blank">Grow Natives</a> tool features 300 species used in restoration and gardening; you can filter on plant characteristics you’re seeking to find species with those traits. You can also search on commercial availability to identify which of our participating nurseries sell that plant.</p>
