		<p>Within walking distance from the Oregon State University Corvallis campus, just beyond its idyllic dairy farm, lies the University&rsquo;s diamond in the rough:  hundreds of acres of the University&rsquo;s managed and unmanaged agricultural lands. A wire fence away from neighborhoods and commercial developments, these properties host meadows, wetlands, rolling hills and woodlands. Here you can find remnants of the vast prairie that once covered two million acres in the Willamette Valley. Sheltered in their wilder places are a handful of plant species&mdash;Nelson&rsquo;s checkermallow, Hall&rsquo;s aster&mdash;that survive only in the vestiges of the valley habitats that are not plowed under or sprayed with herbicides.
		</p>
		<p>OregonFlora is being joined by farmers, community groups, OSU&rsquo;s Department of Animal & Rangeland Sciences, and a diverse group of Oregon State University researchers to help develop and promote a vision for these agricultural lands. It is an opportunity for OSU to fulfill its land grant mission to pioneer, demonstrate, and teach sustainable ways of achieving both agricultural production and biological diversity.
		</p>
		<p>Such a sustainable vision faces real challenges: local food systems have been lost, and farm employment, already historically low, continues to decline. Despite the bulk of Oregon&rsquo;s population being situated in or near the fertile Willamette Valley, the majority of meat consumed here comes from environmentally disastrous Midwestern feedlots, and produce is trucked from California. 
		</p>
		<p>But challenges also present opportunities. OregonFlora and its local ranching partner Brant Cothern, owner of Community Cow, have begun the process of managing portions of OSU&rsquo;s Hill Farm for biodiversity and grass-fed beef production. We have mowed non-native brush and done fence repair and clearing. Targeted grazing is improving the pastures dominated by non-native forage and creating niches for native species we have seeded there. Local markets are being supplied with healthy, local beef products.
		</p>
		<p>Land management techniques that balance the support of biodiverse habitats and food production needs are nothing new&mdash;the Kalapuya and other indigenous people who lived in the Willamette Valley prior to relocation sustainably worked the land for centuries. OregonFlora and its partners are pursuing traditional practices, experimental techniques, and documented research to re-learn how to be part of this gem of a place we call home.
