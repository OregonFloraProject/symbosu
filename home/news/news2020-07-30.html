		When faced with the challenge of documenting some 4,700 different plant types covering 98,466 square miles, how do you get it done? 
		--With a lot of help from your friends! 
		The Friends of the Oregon Flora Project was formed as a committee of the <a href="https://www.npsoregon.org" target="_blank">Native Plant Society of Oregon</a> in 1998 to support the work of the project. 
		This statewide organization of plant enthusiasts has given financial support through its 14 chapters and its many members. 
		Equally important, however, is the exchange of information that takes place: 
		NPSO shares <a href="https://symbiota.oregonflora.org/portal/projects/index.php?pid=2">species lists</a> from its field trips with OregonFlora, 
		coordinates the submission of member plant observations to the <a href="https://symbiota.oregonflora.org/portal/spatial/index.php">Atlas</a>, and tirelessly championed the work of our program which, in turn, strengthens the effectiveness of NPSO. 
		We're thrilled to partner with this organization throughout Oregon!
