		<p>Spring has just arrived and with it a growing excitement about the return of wildflowers and opportunities to photograph them. With the increasingly professional quality of smart phone cameras, more and more people are taking up wildflower photography. But getting the best photograph isn’t all about the equipment (although a good macro lens sure helps!). Here are some tips:</p>

		<p><strong>What is the photo for? </strong>
		There are many reasons to take a photo. I may take photos to use as reference for a drawing, for identification when I get home, to record a precise location for a plant,  or maybe just to remind myself to add it to my plant list. A picture taken to enter in a photo contest is going to look different than one to share as a photo-documented plant specimen or one to post on iNaturalist in hopes of getting help with identification. When you come to a really special plant, taking photos for different purposes—to show its beauty, to capture its habitat, or to highlight particular features—lets your photographic encounter fill different needs. </p>

		<p><strong>What’s helpful for botanists? </strong>
		A great way to increase the value of the images you share with botanical audiences is to be aware of the characters used to identify that species or plant group. You can discover these traits by looking at the identification keys in the <i>Flora of Oregon</i>, or by browsing the descriptions of species in a genus or plant family. 
		<strong><i>Pro tip: </strong></i>  In our <a href="/checklists/dynamicmap.php?interface=key" target="_blank">Identify Plants</a> tool, look for the filter “Groups with specialized keys”.  Here you’ll find distinguishing traits in plant groups that are hard to tell apart. For example, in the ferns, details about sporangia are useful for identification. Taking photos that show sporangia on the undersides of frond leaves will help confirm the identification of your subject and also share this knowledge with others where you’ve posted the image. </p>

		<p><strong>Composition </strong>
		I can’t emphasize enough how important composition is for a high quality photograph. It’s a natural tendency to center the image on what captured your attention—usually a blooming flower. But what about the rest of the picture? Think about the image as a whole. If you are taking a portrait of a tall plant, take a vertical image to fill the space better and show more of the plant. If there is some distracting object in the background like a telephone pole or fence post, try moving your camera or yourself a little to keep it out of the shot. Likewise, getting rid of a few bits of dead grass in the foreground won't hurt the environment and can do wonders for improving a photo.  Slender grasses or plants that blend into their background are extra challenging to capture; adjusting your depth of field or even using a fabric background can help avoid visual clutter. A balanced shot is more interesting that one with the focus dead center. If there are two branches of flowers, look for a way to get both of them in the photo, perhaps one a little higher than the other to create an uneven but balanced composition. </p>

		<p><strong>Lighting </strong>
		Even light is best for getting clear pictures of botanical features. Try to get rid of troublesome shadows across your plant by pushing an offending branch out of the way with your foot (or with the help of a friend). Some people like to photograph in the shade. I prefer the more saturated colors you get in full sun and the better depth of field from more light. The trick to keep your white flowers from being washed out is to use exposure compensation (look for a symbol with “+/-“ signs in a black and white square on your camera). It is also possible to manually set the exposure on many smart phone cameras. </p>
		 
		<p><strong>Post production </strong>
		Do not be afraid to do a little work on the final photo (actually on a copy of your photo unless you're shooting in RAW format). Crop to improve the composition and to get rid of unnecessary elements. This is especially important if you plan to post your photo on the internet where it may be quite small. If you've taken your photo a bit too dark to avoid overexposure, this is the time to brighten it up. </p>

		<p>Taking photos is a great way to help you learn about plants, to create digital memories of your special outings, and to contribute to citizen science. And if you get some good plant photos, check out OregonFlora’s wish list of <a href="/pages/data/OregonFlora_Taxa_Needing_FieldPhotos.csv" target="_blank">species needing images</a> and consider sharing some to add to the resources we provide! </p>
