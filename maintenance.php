<p>The OregonFlora website is temporarily unavailable as we perform updates and website maintenance. We apologize for this inconvenience. We will be adding specialized  characters for Poaceae and Asteraceae into the filtering options of the "Identify Plants" tool.</p>

<p>Due to our recent budget shortfall, all OregonFlora staff have been reduced to half-time appointments for the foreseeable future. Through the generosity of many individual donors, NPSO, and OSU Extension, we now have funds to maintain our program at this reduced level for FY2024--thank you! </p>

<p>We continue to seek support to fully fund the OregonFlora program. This will allow us to complete Volume 3 of the Flora of Oregon in a timely manner, and to continue developing and maintaining the oregonflora.org website--your digital flora. </p>

</p>Questions?  Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@oregonflora.org">info@oregonflora.org</a>.</p>
