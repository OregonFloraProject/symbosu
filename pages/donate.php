                    </h2>
                    <p>From the windswept marshes feeding the mouth of the Columbia, to the craggy face of Steens Mountain; from the pristine meadows of the Wallowas to the serpentine soils of the Siskiyous, Oregon is home to a fragile and varied trove of plant life.</p>
                    <p>And those plants are more than just fun to look at. They clean our air and water, feed and sustain us and the animals ranging our state, contribute to medicines that heal and comfort us, and bring a sense of place to our backyard gardens, planters, and landscapes.</p>
                    <p>In short, we depend upon Oregon’s plant life to help us live better, healthier lives. That’s why our tireless crew of volunteers and staff is dedicated to finding and cataloging every last one of them. Will you help support this important work?</p>

                    <p>Once we really start to look at the natural world, we notice how plants are intertwined with everything. Their patterns and idiosyncrasies are a stunning tapestry to explore, and one our website was specifically designed to illuminate.</p>

Once we start to understand the beauty, complexity, and fragility of the plant life around us, it’s hard not to feel a connection with it—and the importance of protecting it.</p>
                    <p>Supporting OregonFlora doesn’t just support our work providing essential plant information—it builds the kind of appreciation that drives public support for critical land use decisions, environmental and economic policies, and protection of natural areas and parks.</p>
